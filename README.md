## The task

The objective is to create an Airtasker activity feed application that looks like the example below. We've provided an `activity_feed.json` file that contains the data you should be using.

### Design

![alt text](example-over-task.png "Example with mouse over task")
![alt text](example-over-user.png "Example with mouse over user")


### Rules

The code you write should be your own, and should be written without direct assistance. However, feel free to use as many reference resources (Stack Overflow, MDN, Google, textbooks) as you like.

We are comfortable receiving solutions written using the following frameworks:

* React
* Ember
* Vue
* Preact
* None of the above (vanilla JS)

If you'd like to use an alternative language or framework, send us a quick email to check whether we feel comfortable assessing it. We realise the list above can be outdated quickly.


## What we are looking for

There is no one "correct" solution, and there is no trick. The main focus is not a fancy algorithm. Instead, we are looking for thoughtfully written, high quality software. As you write your solution, consider things such as:

* Readability
* Maintainability
* Efficiency
* Testability
* Extensibility

Be prepared to justify your choices.

There are no bonus points for showing off. Good software development skills are far more important to us than extreme language prowess.

Your submission only needs to work in latest Chrome.

To complete the exercise please zip up your solution and email it back to us so we can review your submission.
